# AdventOfCode2022
Done in Python

My solutions to Advent of Code 2022's puzzles. To run all of the solutions at once, just use Day Manager. My goal was to have all parts run in 10 seconds or less.

I usually program in C#, but I decided to do this advent of code in Python to learn the language. From the first to the last day, I have learned new ways to programs and ways to solve problems. Specifically, I absolutely adore dictionaries and sets.

My favorite day overall was Day 18. I just like imagining someone trying to solve it in minecraft.
My favorite Part 1 was on Day 23. It wasn't very difficult, but it was pretty satisfying to solve each part of the program.
My favorite Part 2 was on Day 10. I absolutely love that the answer is given as ascii art.
My least favorite Day was Day 22. It wasn't difficult, just tedious to figure out the math around the cube.
The most difficult Day for me was Day 16. The first time I solved the problem, it took 45 minutes for my Part 2 to run. Later I went back to optimize and to now run in less than 3 seconds.
